							This is what the web use to be, on an old desktop computer just like this. it was around a 1024x768... or 1400x1050... or 800x600... what ever the size was we thought 960px was the perfect size for our websites and life was good! btw I started making and consuming websites on this computer. as soon as we get 960 dialed in new devices start to enter the picture

							</ul>

						<aside class="notes">

							This makes things more confusing, and over all more daunting... we don't want to have to rewrite for every new app that comes out, we want the things we make now to work on devices coming out next Christmas!


							Why is this good for designers? doesn't that just mean more work? sadly it does mean more work, but it also means we get to design for the future through responsive and adaptive webdesign, making us and our work more impactful and valuable.

						<aside class="notes">
							- Finding someone who can code and design at the same time is super hard, expensive, and maybe not the most efficient in every situation
							- This is not an excuse for front end developers to not learn design principals, or designers to not learn how to code. I am a pretty solid advocate for being able to do both, but all our knowledge of mono tasking says you can do a task better and faster if you do it in modular pieces. So my opinion is to do one at a time.

							NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF PAPER!!
							- lets start with the one tool that was the same in both pre-RWD and popular-RWD
								- PAPER! -- there is a reason this is sooo popular! its the fastest way to get ideas down... 
							- Flag your top priorities 
								- mobile users need a quicker way to find things then a 5 layer menue.
								- mobile users don't need the daily deals on the home page, move that to a back page
							
							- Consider what things you can combine to make sure it looks good, and still is navigable

									- you can use multiple pages to create your several views for different browsers
										- then if you need an item you can link it from photoshop and make changes to all the images at once
											- this also allows us an idea of how we will reuse elements.

								- SVG WHAT?!
									- pixel density is becoming a big things, and the one thing everyone is in agreement on is that vector will be coming to the browser soon. Most likely in SVG format.
